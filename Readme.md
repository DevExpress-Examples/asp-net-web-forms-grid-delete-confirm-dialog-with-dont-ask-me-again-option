This example demonstrates how to implement a delete confirmation dialog with an option to prevent its displays for subsequent grid row deletions.

## Implementation Details

The confirm dialog is based on the [ASPxPopupControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxPopupControl). The popup contains the dialog content wrapped in a WebUserControl.

> **Note:** In this example, the "Don't ask confirmation" check box's value is stored in a client JavaScript variable (`dontAskConfirmation`). We recommend that in a real-life application you save this value to a user-specific storage such as cookies or user profile settings.

The example application uses the following techniques:

- The `ID` field value of the processed row is stored in the client `rowVisibleIndex` variable.

- The ASPxPopupControl is made transparent so that it displays its child [ASPxRoundPanel](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxRoundPanel) as the dialog's immediate container.

- The ASPxPopupControl is used in modal mode and configured to always be displayed at the Grid View's center.

- The "Yes" button is made the dialog's default button (its ID is assigned to the ASPxRoundPanel's [DefaultButton](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxPanelBase.DefaultButton) property) so that you can press  `Enter` to submit the dialog. The "Yes" button programmatically receives the input focus after the dialog is shown.
